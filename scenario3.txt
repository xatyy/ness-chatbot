Theodore exits the train, walks through the station full of
commuters, gets on a moving platform. Going through a tunnel,
the walls are hundred foot long screens advertising a new
product. He notices people stopped, watching the ad. We hear
soft, new age, uplifting electronica music in the background,
while a comforting, sincere, older manâ€™s voice speaks to us.
