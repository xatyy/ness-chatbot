Theodore walks through the reception area. The office is 
almost empty except for him and the receptionist, PAUL. 
Theodore begins to scan each letter through a scanner on the 
front desk, then puts them in the outgoing mailbox. 
Paul is sitting at a desk across the room, reading 
handwritten letters on a computer monitor.
