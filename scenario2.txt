SAMANTHA:
(sure of herself, but still sympathetic)
I was starting to think I was crazy. You were saying everything was fine, but all I was getting from you was distance and anger.
THEODORE:
I know. I do that. I did that with Catherine, too. I’d be upset about something and not be able to say it.
And she would sense that there was something wrong, but I would deny it. I don’t want to do that anymore. I want to tell you everything.
SAMANTHA:
Good. Tonight after you were gone, I thought a lot. I thought about you and how you’ve been treating me. And I thought, why do I love you?
And then I felt everything in me let go of everything I was holding onto so tightly.
And it hit me. I don’t have an intellectual reason, I don’t need one.
